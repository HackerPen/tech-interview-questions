## Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].


### Examples

Example 1
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,18], therefore the length is 4.
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

Example 3
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

**constraints**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
