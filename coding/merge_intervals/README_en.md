## Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where each intervals[i] = [start, end], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Examples

Example 1
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

Example 2
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```
