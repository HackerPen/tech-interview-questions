## Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array and an integer k, return the k most freqent elements in any order

### Examples

Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

### **Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

### **Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.
