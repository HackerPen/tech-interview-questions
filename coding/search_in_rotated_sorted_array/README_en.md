## Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

An array is sorted in ascending order is rotated some number of times.

Given the array and a target, return the index of target if it is in the array, or -1 if it is not in the array

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Examples

Example 1
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```
