## Solution for product of array except self


### Approach 1: Left and Right product lists

**algorithm**

- Initialize two empty arrays, L and R where for a given index i, L[i] would contain the product of all the numbers to the left of i and R[i] would contain the product of all the numbers to the right of i.
- We would need two different loops to fill in values for the two arrays. For the array L, L[0] would be 1 since there are no elements to the left of the first element. For the rest of the elements, we simply use `L[i]=L[i−1]∗nums[i−1]`. Remember that `L[i]` represents product of all the elements to the left of element at index i.
- For the other array, we do the same thing but in reverse i.e. we start with the initial value of 1 in `R[length−1]` where lengthlength is the number of elements in the array, and keep updating R[i] in reverse. Essentially, `R[i]=R[i+1]∗nums[i+1]`. Remember that `R[i]` represents product of all the elements to the right of element at index i.
- Once we have the two arrays set up properly, we simply iterate over the input array one element at a time, and for each element at index i, we find the product except self as `L[i] * R[i]`.

**implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {

        // The length of the input array
        int length = nums.length;

        // The left and right arrays as described in the algorithm
        int[] L = new int[length];
        int[] R = new int[length];

        // Final answer array to be returned
        int[] answer = new int[length];

        // L[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
        // Note: for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left,
        // so L[0] would be 1
        L[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {

            // L[i - 1] already contains the product of elements to the left of 'i - 1'
            // Simply multiplying it with nums[i - 1] would give the product of all
            // elements to the left of index 'i'
            L[i] = nums[i - 1] * L[i - 1];
        }

        // R[i] contains the product of all the elements to the right
        // Note: for the element at index 'length - 1', there are no elements to the right,
        // so the R[length - 1] would be 1
        R[length - 1] = 1;
        for (int i = length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {

            // R[i + 1] already contains the product of elements to the right of 'i + 1'
            // Simply multiplying it with nums[i + 1] would give the product of all
            // elements to the right of index 'i'
            R[i] = nums[i + 1] * R[i + 1];
        }

        // Constructing the answer array
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            // For the first element, R[i] would be product except self
            // For the last element of the array, product except self would be L[i]
            // Else, multiple product of all elements to the left and to the right
            answer[i] = L[i] * R[i];
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        # The length of the input array
        length = len(nums)

        # The left and right arrays as described in the algorithm
        L, R, answer = [0]*length, [0]*length, [0]*length

        # L[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
        # Note: for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left,
        # so the L[0] would be 1
        L[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, length):

            # L[i - 1] already contains the product of elements to the left of 'i - 1'
            # Simply multiplying it with nums[i - 1] would give the product of all
            # elements to the left of index 'i'
            L[i] = nums[i - 1] * L[i - 1]

        # R[i] contains the product of all the elements to the right
        # Note: for the element at index 'length - 1', there are no elements to the right,
        # so the R[length - 1] would be 1
        R[length - 1] = 1
        for i in reversed(range(length - 1)):

            # R[i + 1] already contains the product of elements to the right of 'i + 1'
            # Simply multiplying it with nums[i + 1] would give the product of all
            # elements to the right of index 'i'
            R[i] = nums[i + 1] * R[i + 1]

        # Constructing the answer array
        for i in range(length):
            # For the first element, R[i] would be product except self
            # For the last element of the array, product except self would be L[i]
            # Else, multiple product of all elements to the left and to the right
            answer[i] = L[i] * R[i]

        return answer
```

**complexity analysis:**

Time complexity : `O(N)` where `N` represents the number of elements in the input array. We use one iteration to construct the array L, one to construct the array R and one last to construct the answer array using L and R.
Space complexity : `O(N)` used up by the two intermediate arrays that we constructed to keep track of product of elements to the left and right.
