# Design a web crawler

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **Service** crawls a list of urls:
    * Generates reverse index of words to pages containing the search terms
    * Generates titles and snippets for pages
        * Title and snippets are static, they do not change based on search query
* **User** inputs a search term and sees a list of relevant pages with titles and snippets  the crawler generated
    * Only sketch high level components and interactions for this use case, no need to go into depth
* **Service** has high availability

#### Out of scope

* Search analytics
* Personalized search results
* Page rank
