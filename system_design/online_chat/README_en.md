# Design online chat

## Constraints and assumptions
Assume we'll focus on the following workflows:

* Text conversations only
* Users
  - Add a user
  - Remove a user
  - Update a user
  - Add to a user's friends list
    - Add friend request
      - Approve friend request
      - Reject friend request
  - Remove from a user's friends list
  - Create a group chat
  - Invite friends to a group chat
  - Post a message to a group chat
  - Private 1-1 chat
  - Invite a friend to a private chat
  -  Post a meesage to a private chat

* No need to worry about scaling initially
